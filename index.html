            <p>On behalf of the entire K.E. School faculty and staff, I would like to welcome 
all my adorable children and your families to the new academic session of 2021-22.
We, at K. E. always envisage an all around and balanced education based on 
sound intellectual, physical, moral and social formation.
  <br>   <br>           
                
The aim is to make you erudite, patriotic, law abiding and ceaselessly seeking 
excellence, with a deep concern for all especially the weak and the poor sections of
the society. And to my mind, education as an idea, is not just about bricks ,mortar 
and concrete , but about building character , enriching minds and about varied 
experiences that last a lifetime.
    <br>  <br>              
                
COVID-19 Pandemic has surely altered our lives and disrupted normal life 
across the world. We understand the challenges faced by you, your parents and the 
teachers to cater to the academic needs during closure of school and adapting to 
virtual learning. But I am proud at the same time as you continued to demonstrate 
diligence, motivation and determination to work to the best of your abilities to learn 
new instructions.
    <br>  <br>              
                
K.E. assures that, the new academic year 2021-22 is really going to make your 
each second worthwhile as the school has taken initiative in many well planned 
activities and programmes for all to ponder over, act upon and meet with. 
I would like to see my children soaring new heights and tasting success in all 
their endeavours under the guidance and care of our dedicated and hard working 
teachers. Let this Almanac be a step further mentioning all the great plans we put 
forward for our children to achieve the goals expected.
                
                <br>  <br>  
I look further for the sincere cooperation from my teachers, parents and 
guardians too for the attainment of schoolâ€™s objectives to the fullest.
                <br>  <br>  
Thank you
                <br>  <br>
